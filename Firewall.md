<h1 align="center"><b>Firewall</h1>

The growing complexity of the networks, as well as the need to make them more open due to the growing emphasis and attracting the Internet as a means of business transaction, means that networks are increasingly under attack, both externally and internally. Search is used for methods and techniques to protect internal networks from that attacks. One of the most sought-after security measures is the firewall. A firewall protects a network by monitoring access points. Firewalls are becoming more and more sophisticated in the day, and new items are being added all the time, so that, despite criticism and intimidating development methods, they are still a powerful defense.

>## **Introduction**

A firewall is a security tool - computer hardware or software - that can help protect your network by filtering traffic and preventing third parties from gaining unauthorized access to private data on your computer. A firewall not only prevents unwanted traffic, but it can also help to prevent the malicious software from infecting your computer. Firewall software is a program installed on a PC. Hardware firewall is a device placed between your network and the unreliable internet. If more than one computer is connected to the network, it is necessary to protect your network from unreliable internet with a hardware firewall. However, it is also necessary to protect each computer with a software firewall so that if one computer is infected the other computer will be free of the infections and should possesses the following properties :
* Every road from inside to outside, and vice versa, you must pass through.
* Only authorized traffic, as defined by the local safety policy, is permitted to pass through.
* The firewall itself cannot be accessed.

>## **How Firewall works ?**

To begin with, a firewall system analyzes network traffic according to rules. The firewall only accepts incoming links designed to receive. It does this by allowing or blocking certain data packets - communication units that you send through digital networks - based on pre-established security rules.

A firewall acts as a security guard at the installation of your computer, or in the port. Only trusted sources, or IP addresses, are allowed. IP addresses are important because they point to a computer or a source, just as your postal address indicates where you live.

>## **Types of Firewall**
 1. Packet Filtering Firewall 
     A Packet Filtering Firewall is an administrative program that can block an IP protocol network, IP address, and port number. This type of firewall is a basic protection and is designed for small networks.

     But be careful. While this firewalls can be helpful, but they also have certain limitations. Because all web traffic is enabled, the packet filtering firewall does not prevent web-based attacks. Therefore, you need extra protection to distinguish between friendly and risky web traffic.

1.  Applicaion/Proxy Firewall
     A Applicaion/Proxy firewall is a program that can help protect your network security by filtering messages in the application layer. It acts as a gateway or middle man between your internal network and external servers on the web. Also known as the gateway firewall, it is extremely safe in stateful and in-depth packet inspection technology to analyze incoming traffic.

2. Hybrid Firewall
     A hybrid firewall may have a pocket filter attached to the application proxy firewall, or a circuit gateway connected to the application proxy firewall. A firewall is usually the first line of defense against cyber attacks. Unlike other firewalls, however, Network Box uses the Hybrid Firewall to effectively protect your servers and operating systems from malicious probes and unauthorized access.

>## **Firewall Limitations** 
  * A firewall is by its nature perimeter defence, and is not intended to combat the enemy internally, and as a result there is no applicable measure against a user who violates domain access.
  * A firewall is not a real protection against malicious code problems like viruses and Trojan horses, although some can scan code for telltale signs.
  * Adjusting packet filtering rules is often a complex process where errors can occur, leading to security holes. In addition, evaluating established rules tends to be a long and difficult process due to current error tools tools. Standard package filtering routers cannot enforce other security policies because the required information is not available to them.

>## **Conclusions**
   Without the limitation of firewall and the fact that they are not panaceas for all aspects of network security,nor the sole sufficient bulwark against network intrusion, and despite the alarming development trends, powerful protective mechanism, and will continue to play an important and critical role in maintaining network security for some years now, and any organisation that ignores them does so at its peril.
   They are constantly changing and evolving, and new features are being added whenever needed. If the development follows the current trend, they will continue to integrate manageable control and verification methods with their traditional functions, thus providing strong and flexible protection for networks to make them safer.
